<h1>Redux Toolkit Project</h1>

<p>This project is a small demonstration of using Redux Toolkit, a package that simplifies Redux development by providing utility functions and best practices. It showcases how to effectively manage state using Redux Toolkit's features and conventions.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Redux Store</strong>: Set up a Redux store using Redux Toolkit.</li>
  <li><strong>Slice Reducers</strong>: Define slice reducers to handle specific parts of the application state.</li>
  <li><strong>Action Creators</strong>: Use Redux Toolkit's createSlice function to automatically generate action creators.</li>
  <li><strong>Immutability</strong>: Ensure immutability of the state using Redux Toolkit's immer integration.</li> 
  <li><strong>DevTools Integration</strong>: Enable Redux DevTools extension for enhanced debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Redux Toolkit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To get started with this Redux Toolkit project, follow the instructions below:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/sundram2201/React-Redux.git</code></pre>

<ol start="2">
  <li>Install the necessary dependencies by running the command:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

<ol start="3">
  <li>Start the development server with the command:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code>npm start</code></pre>



<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Once the project is up and running, you can explore the different Redux Toolkit features and how they are implemented in the codebase.</p>

<h3>Redux Store</h3>

<p>The Redux store is set up in the <code>store.js</code> file. It includes the initial state and registers the slice reducers.</p>

<h3>Slice Reducers</h3>

<p>Slice reducers are defined in separate files within the <code>slices</code> directory. Each slice reducer manages a specific part of the application state.</p>

<h3>Action Creators</h3>

<p>Action creators are automatically generated using the <code>createSlice</code> function provided by Redux Toolkit. They can be found in the respective slice files within the <code>slices</code> directory.</p>

<h3>Immutability</h3>

<p>Immutability of the state is ensured through Redux Toolkit's integration with <a href="https://immerjs.github.io/immer/">immer</a>. This allows for simpler and more readable state updates.</p>

 

  

<h3>DevTools Integration</h3>

<p>The Redux DevTools extension is integrated with the project, providing enhanced debugging capabilities. You can access it in your browser's developer tools.</p>
